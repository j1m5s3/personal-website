                <p>
                    Hey there, I am a Muay Thai practitioner  who also loves to play video games and code in my free time.
                    I graduated from the University of Massachusetts Lowell with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering in 2019.

                    In 2018, I became interested in personal finance, which eventually led me to the world of cryptocurrency in late 2019.
                    From my own study and reading builder experiences made me realize the importance of taking initiative in the technology space, 
                    and I have since developed a passion for building solutions to problems and always trying to act on those solutions.
                    In my free time, I like to work on my personal projects, and try to execute on whatever ideas pop into my head.
